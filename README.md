# Raster_Animations
The following repository contains a simple set of codes to create animations using Google Earth Engine-based Image Collections.
The collection can be replaced with other products. To understand how the trend part of the code works please check out the mover code on my repository https://github.com/NotnirwaN/Pollutant_Trend_Analysis/tree/main
